1 - RADAR STATIONS
  A player can build and install ONE radar station in each one of his/her
  planets. The player can then "Examine" the radar screen(s) via a (new)
  command, (E)xamine Radars, in the Navy Management menu. If an enemy
  squadron is on its way to attack a planet in which a radar station is
  installed, and if the squadron is within the range of the radar, a
  report describing the squadron is printed as a response to "Examine
  Radars" command.

  There are 3 classes of radar stations:

   Class	Range		industry units		Technology Level
	   (in light years)	    needed 		    required
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
short range       4                 100                        5
mid range         8                 300                        12
long range        12                700                        20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


   A player can install a longer range radar station in a planet which 
   already has a (shorter range) station; but the shorter range radar
   will be dismantled (no net increase in the total number of radar
   stations as reported in the "Empire Status").

   If a player captures another player's planet the radar station installed
   in the captured planet by its ex-ownoer, if any, will be destroyed during
   the fight.


2 - STATUS OF SQUADRONS SENT
   The "Status" command in the Navy Management menu now prints the status
   of all of the player's squadrons in the move.  The status includes
   destination planet, speed, distance still left, and the counts of
   ships in the squadron.

3 - ADDITIONS TO REPORTS 
   The planet status report and the empire status report now include
   radar stations installed.
